<p>At approximately 1:40PM today (and it is a sunny and warm day), I walked into my bedroom at my dad&#8217;s house and found Brea the cat preening herself on top of the large rectangular plastic storage bins. (A few days ago I saw Brea taking interest in another neighborhood cat and chasing after it. Brea lives in what I consider to be one of the best cat habitats I have ever seen; an upscale, luxurious, and well landscaped neighborhood in the highlands and right next to the sprawling alpine forests northeast of Lake Chabot).</p>
<p>I had a good time having brunch down near the Castro Village shopping center. I ran into my housemate Steve at the grocery store where I bought some vegan munchies. Then I bought a large coffee from the Pete&#8217;s cafe (which is always teeming with people enjoying the cafe scene). Then I walked up the hill while brainstorming about topics such as Universal Basic Income, Socialism, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Terraforming Mars, Space Travel, Sustainable Energy, Work-Life Balance, Academics, and Entrepreneurship (and I came up with an idea for a product to sell which is a &#8220;bug out bag&#8221; equipped with everything I consider to be essential gear including a sleeping bag and laptop computer (and I doubt such a business idea would be feasible nor profitable)).</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel a lot better than I did yesterday and the day before that because I started opening up to the idea of just being a full time student until I get a job in the Information Technology sector (especially a job involving technical documentation and software development). I feel inspired to get back into software development more regularly and intensely. C++ is my favorite programming language and the first programming language I learned. Second to that is JavaScript (especially for building minimalist and self-contained single web page applications). I have plenty to do with my time but, seemingly like most other people living in this time in human history, I never seem to have enough time. There is some kind of phenomenon which has a name (and that phenomenon (which is named <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parkinson&#8217;s law</a>) is the tendency for some task to fill up all the time allotted to it no matter how much time is allotted to it).</p>

<p>I neglected to mention something which happened earlier today. I decided to sleep in the bushes at Proctor Elementary School thinking that no one would see me there. People apparently did because&#8230;</p>
<p>(There are people loudly banging on things outside the garage I am in and sometimes making vocalizations. I am not sure whether they are simply minding their own business doing yard work or if they are trying to send me nonverbal cues to get the fuck out of their nesting space. I am tentatively planning on camping in the backwoods or in the strip of wilderness near my mom&#8217;s house later today. I have a dreadful suspicion that many people are opposed to me working at home. My dad just opened the garage door of the garage I am in. I think other people are deliberately trying to prevent me from pursuing my career of choice and instead prefer I feel too interfered with and sabotaged by other people to do anything but run away from home to be a full-time sweatshop employee so that my academic and creative and lifestyle goals are permanently thwarted. I do not really feel that I am welcome in my own neighborhood and that people are waging war on me every day and all day).</p>
<p>&#8230;someone called the cops on me and I was asked questions like whether I was a sex offender, in possession of weapons, or taking medication for some psychiatric illness. I was told that I would be arrested if I was caught on the premises of that school again. I noticed a white nuclear family talking smugly nearby and enjoying the campus as a place to play basketball or take a family stroll. I wonder if people are seriously threatened by the prospect of me simply having uninterrupted time to think while unsupervised and while in public.</p>
<p>(I can hear annoying voices of actual people outside which vaguely sound like pig_gorl. I would be wearing my ear plugs and over ear headphones to that noise generator app I have on my phone but I keep getting too much caustic interference from thought police while listening to it in close proximity to other people who seem agitated by my presence. I suppose that is my cue to get the fuck out and to accept that I am of a lower caste than seemingly everyone else is who lives in this town).</p>
<p>It should be noted that, according to the police, I am on probation for vandalism and petty theft which both occurred more than two years ago and that the probation period is supposed to end in March 2024. While I am on probation, the police are entitled to search my backpack. Thankfully I have nothing illegal on my person.</p>

<p>It could be that AJP and/or other people are vehemently opposed to me being entirely financially supported by my family of origin while having what looks like unlimited free time to do whatever I want. What I am suggesting is that those who oppose me making software development and hobbies as big of a priority as I make them are jealous of me and hence want to deprive me of what makes them jealous.</p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Like I said earlier, I probably have no feasible options for how to proceed with my goals other than to live outside of Castro Valley. I might even be prevented by other territorial people from even being able to use the wilderness near my legal residence as a place to hang out and study because such people are so vehemently opposed to me achieving my goals. If that is seriously opposed to my thriving the locals are, then I will head to Dublin or Fremont and make my home in those parts instead of anywhere near Castro Valley.</span></p>

<p><span style="background:#00ff00">What sucks is how I know I could be saving lots more money and getting a lot more done with my time if I was allowed to do my &#8220;work&#8221; in Castro Valley instead of bullied into leaving. I heard my mom say that she considered cutting me off financial support so that I am not able to live outside of Castro Valley (but all that would lead to is me feeling cornered and deprived of privacy and space to do my own thing without being micromanaged by insecure control freaks surveilling me in close proximity and with the power to cut me off from whatever I am doing to the extent that I am unable to establish any sort of daily routine). That&#8217;s the only reason I am still very likely to keep applying for full-time jobs (because there are almost no part-time jobs being listed on Indeed.com and because the only jobs I have been able to do during the past five years which have not caused me serious distress are warehouse jobs instead of customer service jobs).</span></p>
