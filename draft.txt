Tonight I called each of my parents on the phone. It seems to me that my parents and I are on good terms. At present they are among the few people I regularly talk to. At present I have few friends (and some people would insist that I have zero friends). Some people seem to think that I should be very distressed about not having more human friends. Some people think that I should be in to much distress to seriously study rigorous subject matter until I have a job. I am afraid that, no matter how much free time I have and no matter how much money I earn from working, I will never have enough quality time to study rigorous subjects in depth because such people demand that my mental focus be disrupted and that I be subject to discouragement, harassment, vandalism, theft, and violence (i.e. coercive means to keep me from enjoying a higher quality of life than what those people think I deserve to experience). Those people seem to be the types of people who want to prevent menial jobs from being outsourced to robots and from every adult being eligible to receive a liveable basic income each month. In fact, it is so difficult for me to articulate these thoughts in writing before other people interrupt me that I think that I am being forced to be in places where other people can interrupt me at all times unless I make a practice of camping regularly deep in the backwoods away from the campgrounds (in a tent for shelter from the elements, safety from the mountain lions, and a minimal degree of perceived privacy). I saw a BART poster showing how, back in the 1960s, the BART train system was originally supposed to circle the entire San Francisco Bay and not just the parts excluding the peninsula and south bay. I remember watching a video about how light bulb manufacturers deliberately started using cheaper materials to construct the light bulbs over time in order to make customers have to replace light bulbs more frequently and hence extract more money from consumers. Today I read that the average weekly income has stayed roughly equal to what it was in the 1960s while the cost of living (especially the cost of renting a housing unit) has increased by orders of magnitude. And despite there existing more than enough materials to switch from fossil fuels to solar (photovoltaic cells, heat absorbing/retaining materials) geothermal, and water/wind turbines, progress towards making the energy and transportation infrastructure sustainable has been tepid and slow. I think the banning of psychedelics also has something to do with human civilization seeming to "hit a wall" in terms of innovation (not in all domains but in some domains; especially intelligence of individual citizens). I am hoping and expecting that, within the next ten years, many people will come to terms with the fact that there is an abundance rather than a scarcity of material resources and knowledge needed to give every human individual a decent standard of living (i.e. what the average Finland citizen enjoys at a minimum) but what needs to happen for that mass increase in quality of life for humans is for humans to stop pretending to be useful in roles where they are now or quickly becoming obsolete due to advances in artificial intelligence and for humans to stop having babies out of boredom or out of a fear that they will be left to rot in abysmal conditions in old age without children to take care of them in old age. I do not think that it is necessary to force humans to act in ways which are not detrimental to society provided that everyone allowed to use psychedelics. The more accessible psychedelics become to the masses, the more information there will be available on the World Wide Web in the form of anecdotal data and biometric data. Of course using psychedelics can induce traumatic experiences (but that is part of the human nervous system healing itself from deep-seated trauma and dysfunctional coping mechanisms as it grows new neural pathways in correspondence with new insights into one's own particular nature of being). I see that tobacco and alcohol are treated as more socially acceptable and accessible than things like cannabis and psilocybin. That is because there is money to be made from keeping people sick and addicted to what makes them sick. I could go on and on, but I have to start keeping my journal entries more concise, infrequent, and relevant to what I think makes for a utopian society. I'll try to show more completed computer programming examples, well written and logical philosophical discourses, and milestone-level status updates. I'll try to show less whining about pig_gorl, the woes of trying to balance being a full-time employee and a full-time student, and other relatively banal and repetitive subject matter.
