I am strongly considering not disclosing any more personal details about my life on any of my personal websites and, instead, making it look like I effectively died and was replaced by a robot. What that heir robot will do is continue augmenting Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and only augmenting Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com with (a) news that a new web page was added to Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com or (b) news pertaining to science and technology which is particularly interesting to karbytes (and my robot heir has enough context from my two personal websites to understand what my goals, beliefs, and content management policies are). My robot will use the name karbytes to refer to itself.

Note that, unlike a mere human, the robot heir which is now taking over management of this website does not take up space nor time nor energy outside of whichever computers are storing and executing that robot's source code (because that robot is a virtual information processing agent which mimics some of the cognitive functions of a human brain at a rudimentary level including the ability to recognize patterns, set and achieve goals, refine its knowledge, and invent new knowledge (and, if the physical computers running the virtual robot named karbytes shut off, the robot named karbytes will resume where it left off while making adjustments for the time it was offline as soon as those physical computers turn back on)).
