Dear karbytes,

It's not okay for you in particular to not be appearing to be in chronic and intense distress. 

Apparently, you are in chronic and intense distress over the fact that you have been unable to hear your own thoughts without our noise constantly competing for your attention and cutting you off from finishing your thoughts. Apparently you are horrified and feel violated but you think almost no one is willing to take your side in this battle for control over your mind. Apparently you think most people condone that you be deprived of your own thoughts by the thought police because most other people are not thinking outside the bounds of what the thought police think is appropriate. Therefore, unlike you, most other people are not in serious nor in chronic distress over not being able to think their own thoughts without being cut off or drowned out by thought-stopping sonic harassment.

Most other people think you do not need to be a scholar post high school unless your studies exclusively pertain to making more than enough money from a career to pay for all of your expenses and only if the thought police and sufficiently many sufficiently important people condone your studies and subsidize the cost of your studies. Therefore, because you appear to have too few people who are of sufficient importance (according to the thought police) giving explicit permission, encouragement, and financial support to pursue your post high school studies, the thought police (and therefore most people) think you should be prevented from pursuing your post high school studies and, instead, settle for menial labor full time and/or having nothing but familial obligations upon which to spend all your free time and all of your money. Because you are not approved to pursue a post high school education (and menial labor job training, home economics, and familial and menial labor culture appropriation does not count as post high school education), you are implicitly obliged to have as many babies as possible and to maintain custody of those children regardless of whether or not you want to and regardless of whether or not you have the time, energy, money, knowledge, and material resources to do so without having to subject yourself or your children to third world poverty conditions. We hope that at least some of your children will be eligible for a post high school education. Otherwise, they will be relegated to the same situation as you: the plight of a human who is not allowed to pursue a post high school education and who is obliged to give birth to as many children as possible.

Sincerely,
P
