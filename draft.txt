Some people seem to be very opposed to me not staying indoors when I am in the backyards of my parents' houses. 

Some people seem to be very opposed to not traveling by car when I am walking instead.

Some people seem to go out their way to ridicule me and to demoralize me using their words and non verbal signals to suggest that I am too vain and too self absorbed to be a good student or a good employee/entrepreneur.

Some people seem to be implicitly and adamantly insisting that I should commit myself to a mental hospital or homeless shelter with the goal of getting assistance from the government in terms of low income housing and low wage employment if not outright commit suicide because such people are opposed to me living with my parents rent free and entirely (or even partially) financially supported by my parents because (a) my critics think I am too old to be in that kind of living situation and (b) my critics think that my social nonconformity and/or criminal history should disqualify me from enjoying that kind of living situation.

Some people seem to think that I should be closely monitored by other people at all times to ensure that my thoughts do not stray outside the bounds of what those people think is appropriate and that I should be interrupted with jarring feedback (especially auditory stimuli) which is designed to prevent me from pursuing those stray thoughts so that I have too little intellectual autonomy to escape the social matrix which seems to bully me into staying socially isolated, intellectually limited, and too miserable to do what I want to do if what I want to do is not approved of by those who monitor my thoughts and who try to control my thoughts.

I anticipate that, within the next twenty years, all adults and emancipated minors will be eligible to receive a universal basic income which is sufficient to pay for those people's basic living expenses and, also, all health care will be free. The money to pay for everyone's upkeep would come from taxes paid by companies which mostly if not entirely employ robots instead of humans. Most humans would spend their time pursuing creative, academic, social, spiritual, and charitable interests which may or may not reward those humans with money and other meritocratic benefits. A minority of humans will do little more than keep to themselves and subsist entirely on the government provided universal basic income.

By the way, I lied in a recent journal entry that I was running away from home to be a full time homeless person and that I was leaving my electronics behind and that I was no longer accepting money from my parents.

Finally, it should be noted that I think it is possible for people to decode what my verbal thoughts are without having to decode my brain activity directly by decoding the electrical signals which travel across some of the nerves in my throat and face in patterns which correspond with my unspoken verbal thoughts and that it is possible to induce auditory, visual, and olfactory "hallucinations" in only one human target using wireless electromagnetic signals which are targeted to specific regions of my skull (with or without some kind of brain-to-computer interface). I wrote about that (hypothetical) technological telepathy in a journal entry which I published last year.
