karbytes: "Do you want me to get a job or not?"

P: "I don't want you to get a job. I want you to stay home and be too stressed out to do anything."

karbytes: "Why?"

P: "I want you to spend more time worrying about someone other than yourself."

karbytes: "Even a part time minimum wage job would give me some degree of financial independence which I would not have any of without a job. I expect that I would earn enough money from having a job to attain a more satisfying standard of living and hence enable me to have the requisite sense of abundance to contribute charitably to others without feeling that I am depleting myself financially to do so."

P: "No you're not. You're not gonna be making enough money anytime soon (or ever) to barely pay for yourself; you selfish asshole. Stop pretending to be useful to others when you're just a burden to them. If it wasn't for your parents providing you a house, car, and spending money you would have been sent away to the middle of the country on a charter bus where you would be forced to start your life over as a homeless person in a foreign town."

karbytes: "What do you want from me?"

P: "Your undivided love and devotion."

karbytes: "I don't want to provide those things to you because I strongly dislike you (and prefer you to be swiftly murdered)."

P: "Then you need to be put in a straitjacket and left in a mental hospital for at least a few weeks for threatening to harm me."

karbytes: "I'm not threatening to harm you at this place and time, but if you corner me and I have the means to physically harm you, I might resort to physically assaulting you (but my violent actions towards you would be an act of self defense in response to you appearing to be.threatening to inflict a similar degree of physical violence against me)."

P: "You will never get away with expressing violent threats against me because you don't know what I look like nor where I am located nor any personally identifying details about me because I am only interacting with you telepathically."

karbytes: "Then you have no reason to fear being the target of my physical violence."

P: "I make up and enforce the rules. You don't. I never get punished even if I appear to be breaking those rules. I belong to an untouchable and supremely powerful class within society. You don't. You're beneath me. I can do whatever I want to you. No one's gonna stop me."

karbytes: "Perhaps I should commit suicide so that you don't have me to bully anymore."

P: "Maybe I will drive you to commit suicide when I tire of playing with you. Maybe I will have you incarcerated at a mental hospital, prison, or very unpleasant hostage situation in order to prevent you from escaping by any means from the torment I subject you to."
