Brown blue collar men are always invading my space and trying to make me feel deprived of solitude out of jealousy and chauvanism. 

They tend to not leave me alone even if I leave the premises to go somehow else nearby. They follow me over there. The "fight" typically lasts longer than 20 minutes. I think those people want to prevent me from doing anything but sleeping or working a blue collar job.

Such people seem chronically angry and immature bratty children who diminish my quality of life and who impede my goals.
