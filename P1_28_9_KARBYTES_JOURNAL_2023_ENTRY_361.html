<p>Hypothesis: an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> such as a human has some degree of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volition</a> which it can, at some decision-making points, choose to relinquish some of by making some decisions. Likewise, it could be that <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God</a> initially has limitless volition to instantiate any phenomena (and any phenomena it wants to) and, once God (which is synonymous with the whole of nature and which is fundamentally one ubiquitous field of consciousness imagining all phenomena which are ever observed to occur by any information processing agent) decides to partition some of its consciousness into becoming a particular information processing agent, God experiences a reduction in its volition for the duration of that information agent&#8217;s lifespan (from the perspective of that particular information processing agent while incarnated as that particular information processing agent).</p>
